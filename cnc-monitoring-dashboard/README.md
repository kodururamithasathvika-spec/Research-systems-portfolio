# CNC Machine Monitoring Dashboard

## Purpose
Design a real-time monitoring system to visualize operational parameters of CNC machines.

## Implementation
Sensor data streamed to a Python-based GUI using Tkinter and Matplotlib, enabling live visualization of RPM, temperature, and vibration signals.

## Validation
System tested with real-time data streams and verified through continuous graphical updates.

## Status
System validated with live monitoring.
