# Image-Based Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Problem
Design a real-time hand gesture recognition system for human–computer interaction
with emphasis on robustness and interpretability.

## Methodology
Hand images were processed using classical feature descriptors (HOG, LBP, ORB).
Dimensionality reduction was applied using PCA.
Multiple classifiers were evaluated: KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

## Evaluation
Random Forest achieved the best performance with approximately 95% accuracy,
outperforming other classifiers.

## Status
Validated using offline dataset results.
