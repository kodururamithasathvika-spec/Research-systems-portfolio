## Assistive Hand Gesture Glove – Prototype Overview

This project presents a wearable assistive hand gesture glove designed to
translate predefined hand gestures into textual messages for basic
communication assistance. The system targets simple Human–Computer Interaction
(HCI) scenarios where verbal communication may be limited.

The focus of this project is on hardware integration, sensor interfacing, and
real-time system behavior rather than algorithmic novelty or software
optimization.

### Note on Implementation
Source code is not publicly released for this prototype. The project is
presented to demonstrate system-level integration, real-time response, and
assistive application feasibility.

This prototype was developed as a collaborative academic project, with my
primary contribution focused on system integration, hardware assembly, and
experimental validation.
