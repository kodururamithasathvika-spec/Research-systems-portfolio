# Assistive Hand Gesture Glove – Prototype Overview

This project presents a wearable assistive hand gesture glove designed to translate predefined hand gestures into textual messages for basic communication assistance. The system targets simple Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) scenarios where verbal communication may be limited.

The emphasis of this work is on **system-level hardware integration, real-time sensing, and experimental validation**, rather than algorithmic novelty or software optimization.

## Contribution & Scope

This prototype was developed as part of an **academic, research-oriented collaborative project**.

My **primary contributions** include:
- Hardware integration and sensor interfacing  
- Embedded system assembly and wiring  
- System validation through repeated experimental testing  
- Evaluation of real-time response and system stability  

This repository is intended to demonstrate **system integration capability, real-time behavior, and assistive application feasibility**, rather than software-level innovation.
