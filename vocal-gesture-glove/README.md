## Assistive Hand Gesture Glove – Prototype Overview

This project presents a wearable assistive hand gesture glove designed to
translate predefined hand gestures into textual messages for basic
communication assistance.

The focus of this project is on hardware integration, sensor interfacing,
and real-time system behavior rather than algorithmic novelty or software
optimization.

### System Description
- Flex sensors mounted on fingers for gesture capture
- Embedded microcontroller for signal interpretation
- Predefined gesture-to-text mapping
- Real-time output displayed on LCD module

### Note on Implementation
Source code is not publicly released for this prototype. The project is
presented to demonstrate system-level integration, real-time response, and
assistive application feasibility.
